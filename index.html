            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a 27-year-old, self-taught software developer from Atlantic Canada with over two years of professional experience. I began my programming journey as a child, making text-based, "Choose Your Own Adventure," style games in the Windows Command Prompt using Batch scripts. Since then my passion for programming has only grown more and more. Over the years I have taught myself several programming languages including C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, Go, and many, many more. Most recently I have been studying the Elixir programming language, which I am considering using in a future project.</p>
            <p>Aside from programming, I also have a strong passion for the arts. Since the age of eight I've been a guitar player, and I've dabbled in other instruments as well as digital audio workstations such as Ableton and FL Studio. When I'm writing code, I like to listen to electronic music such as Aphex Twin and Boards of Canada, but my music tastes are incredibly diverse overall.</p>
            <p>As of this writing, I am actively seeking work. If you like what you see here and you're interested in hiring me, feel free to reach out to me and I will get back to you ASAP. Contact details are in the <a href="/resume">resume</a> section.</p>
